# PNM Image Manipulation
This is a program to receive and apply some filters in PNM images using matrices. Itâ€™s more for educational purposes since PNM format is not very common, but the code might give some interest. To compile you have to pass the image title (through command line along with the standard C++ code compiling command), and then select filters. Several images are there as examples of what the program should do.

## Main programming concepts included in this project:
- Basic programming concepts: conditionals, loops, functions and more
- 2D arrays manipulation
