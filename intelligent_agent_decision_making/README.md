# CodinGame Fantastic Bits Bots

This project was made by me as a work on my AI class at college. It is a bot that does basic decisions and have some intelligent acting for a platform called CodinGame that you code bots so they can compete against other player's bots. The code was entirely made by myself, feel free to use as long as you give credits.
