# The classic Snake game using double linked lists and object oriented programming
This program was fully written in the C++ language and contain three classes with their header files and C++ files and the **JogoSnake.cpp** file that contains a user interface implementation using then ncurses library and if you you compile this file along with your classes you will have game. It is also important to say that this game didnâ€™t focus on efficiency, but rather train these programming concepts below.

## Commands used to compile this game:
- **Remember that you need to have the ncurses library installed on your machine for the game to work properly**
- In the terminal, use: g++ jogoSnake.cpp Snake.cpp Game.cpp Screen.cpp -lncurses -o jogoSnake.exe

## Main programming concepts included here:
- Basic programming: conditionals, loops, functions and more
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Object oriented programming
- Data structures (the snake is a double linked list of nodes)

Also, the pdf file contains a better explanation of how this code should work, feel free to read, but this document is all written in portuguese.
