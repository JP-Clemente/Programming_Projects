# Dynamic Matrix Multiplication Using Traditional Method and Strassen's Algorithm

This is a program to calculate matrices using the normal algorithm (1.C) and the Strassen's Algorithm (2.C). Since matrix multiplication is an operation with high memory cost, huge numbers are not supported, but both algorythms can handle considerably big matrices. The complexity order of Strassen's algorythm is a bit lower (N^2,8) compared to the normal one (N^3), but since the implementation is a bit complex, might not be better than the common one.
