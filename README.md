# College Projects
This repository contains some of my most relevant work from programming subjects at my college during my graduation, mainly made using Python, C and C++ language. Some of the coding you'll find here have some complexity and involve some advanced concepts of programming. As you chose a project, there will be an explanation inside it's folder on how to compile it and how it works. All coding you'll find here was mostly written by me, Jo√£o Pedro Clemente Borges, feel free to use as long as you give the credits.

## Main programming concepts these projects include:
- Basic programming concepts: conditionals, loops, functions, recursivity and more
- Pointers and references
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Object oriented programming
- Operator overloading
- Templates
- Data structures
- AI algorithms, and problem solving
