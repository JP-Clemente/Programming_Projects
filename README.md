# College Projects
This repository contains some of my most relevant work from programming subjects at my college during my graduation, mainly made using Python, C and C++ language. Some of the coding you'll find here have some complexity and involve some advanced concepts of programming. There will be an explanation inside the folder of each project on how to compile it and how it works. All coding you'll find here was mostly written by me, Jo√£o Pedro Clemente Borges.

## Main Programming Concepts These Projects Include:
- Basic Programming Concepts: Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Recursivity and More
- Pointers and References
- Dynamic Memory Allocation
- Object Oriented Programming
- Operator Overloading
- Templates
- Data Structures
- AI Algorithms and Problem Solving
- Computer Networking
- Optimized Algorithms in General
